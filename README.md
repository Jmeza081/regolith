# Regolith

A native Android video player for files on your own SMB share, with
Jellyfin-style thumbnail scrubbing. Nothing is copied off the share and
nothing leaves your network. Kotlin + Jetpack Compose.

## Status

Phase 1 of 6 complete: add an SMB server by address, pick shares, browse
folders, and play video straight off the share with resume. Verified on a
Pixel emulator and on a real phone against a NAS. Browse is plain rows and the
player has minimal controls on purpose; artwork, the full player and the
design polish are Phases 2, 3 and 6. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the plan.

## Build and run

Requirements: Android Studio 2026.1 (for its bundled JDK 21 and the SDK),
SDK platform 37, an Android 14+ device or the `Pixel_10` emulator.

```
./gradlew assembleDebug        # compile
./gradlew installDebug         # build + install on the running emulator
./gradlew test                 # JVM unit tests
./gradlew connectedAndroidTest # Compose UI tests on the emulator
./gradlew lint
```

No separate Java install is needed, but the `gradlew` launcher itself needs a
JVM before it can read `gradle.properties`, so point it at Android Studio's
bundled JDK once per shell:

```
export JAVA_HOME="/Applications/Android Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home"
```

`local.properties` (gitignored) must contain `sdk.dir=/Users/<you>/Library/Android/sdk`;
Android Studio writes it on first open, or create it by hand.

Emulator driving and QA go through the argent MCP tools (see `CLAUDE.md`).
